Why is Open Banking being introduced? - 
Open Banking is an industry-wide initiative. It’s led by the UK Competition and Markets Authority, in partnership with Lloyds Bank, other large UK banks and consumer groups. The goal is to: - 
increase transparency and competition - 
give customers more control over their data - 
promote innovation in financial services - 
At Lloyds Bank, we want to do what’s best for our customers. Making sure you have access to innovative products and services is part of this. That’s why we’re working alongside the regulator, consumer groups and many others to make this happen. -
