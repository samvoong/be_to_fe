# BE to FE Assignment By Sammy Voong

I have tried to create a blog application using the 3rd party back-end: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide.html.
This app fetches the existing posts from the 3rd party API, adds new posts to the API via form input and loads the new posts onto the list page.
I was hoping to add a lot more, but many things got in the way :(. Also, I'm very sorry for the lateness of the submission! It wasn't intended at all. I would appreciate any feedback on this app. Thank you!
